## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Angular 16 Signals**: Efficient state management for complex UI components.
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimized module loading for improved initial load times.
- **Node.js Backend**: A robust backend developed using Node.js to support the application's functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **Angular CLI** (installed globally)
- **MongoDB**: This project requires a MongoDB connection string. By default, it uses a personal MongoDB URL, so no setup is required.

### Environment Variables

The project requires an environment variable `MONGOURL` to connect to a MongoDB instance. For ease of use, the `.env` file is already set up with a personal MongoDB URL.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
$ git clone
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
$ cd Arkeyd.app
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
$ npm install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to see the application running.

### Production Build

To create a production build of the project, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## üß© Backend

The backend is built with **Node.js** and requires no additional setup since the MongoDB URL is pre-configured.


## üìñ What I Learned

This project provided an in-depth exploration into Angular 16's **signals** and **lazy loading** capabilities. Performance optimization techniques were applied, resulting in a Lighthouse score of 99 for performance. This study also involved implementing best practices in Angular development to ensure a highly accessible and SEO-friendly application.
